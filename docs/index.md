## What is Datarails?
Datarails is a simple framework for organizing your in memory Dataframe based ETL jobs. It doesn't matter of you are using `pandas`, `spark`, `glue` or anything else
this library serves as a simple way to structure and document your ETL jobs so that others don't come along and have to debug your 300 line script by copy / pasting sections of it into
a jupyter notebook.
